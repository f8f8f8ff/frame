# frame

frame is an image collaging software.
drag images into frame and manipulate them.

right click opens the operation menu.
escape or right click cancels an operation.
space repeats previous operation.

guidelines:

- no drawing. no lines, fills, or text.
- no color manipulation (alpha manipulation OK)
- prioritize rectilinear operations
- no undo. edit destructively.
- no saving state. screenshot it to save it.

todo:

- [ ] rotate operation
- [ ] reduce / increase alpha
- [ ] photoshop-like distort (maybe)

bugs:

- plenty
